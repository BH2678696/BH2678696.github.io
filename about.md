# About Me
Hello! I am BH!

Since you are here, I might as well tell you a few things about me. I like reading books, however, I'm not reading a lot lately. I'm trying to get myself to read more. My favorite subject is math (any type), and it's been like that for years. I think computer science is a cool class, even though it can sometimes be complicated. I was actually a little nervous when I first attened this class, but I quickly realized that it can be a fun class if you know what you're doing.
