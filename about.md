# About Me
Hello! I am BH!

Since you are here, I might as well tell you a few things about me. I like reading books, however, I'm not reading a lot lately. I'm trying to get myself to read more. My favorite subject is math (any type), and it's been like that for years. I think computer science is a cool class, even though it can sometimes be complicated. I was actually a little nervous when I first attended this class, but I quickly realized that it can be a fun class if you know what you're doing (I might have to look into that because computer science isn't my expertise).

When I was little, I had a dream that I wanted to become a doctor when I grew up. My goal is to get more knowledge and info on how to become a successful medical expert. I'm looking further into subjects such as science and math to improve my current skills on these courses. When I first took computer science, it was only because I thought it was cool class to take for my CTE choice. Okay, I'm not saying that it wasn't cool, just that I wasn't particularly the best at the class. Honestly, I was struggling a bit on some of the concepts. However, I slowly realized that there was more to this class other than typing down random stuff until you get it right. It pushed me to think deeper when I made mistakes, and enabled me to become better at problem solving. Surpassing subjects such as math, science, and english are still essential for my future if I want to get accepted into a good college, but I never really had a huge problem passing those classes. Computer science allowed me to build on my current skills and add to it, little by little because I have think critally, whereas in math, everything just comes to me when I'm going through lessons, and I don't have to think much. A course I thought was going to be boring is actually helping me get closer to achieving my future goal of becoming a doctor. So, in the end, it's important to push forward, even during the toughest times because it'll be worth it. Even if you fail, you're one step closer than before. You got this. 

Have a great day to whoever is reading this :).
